# Unsupervised_Learning
Objective: Utilize unsupervised learning to cluster crptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. 

# Instructions 
1. Import the data 
2. Prepare the data  
3. Find the best value for k by using the original data.
4. Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means by using the original data.
5. Optimize the clusters with principal component analysis.
6. Find the best value for k by using the PCA data.
7. Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means by using the PCA data.
8. Visualize and compare the results.

## Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data 
Use the elbow method to find the best value for k by using the original data. To do so, complete the following steps:
1. Code the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for k. Use a range from 1 to 11.
2. To visually identify the optimal value for k, plot a line chart of all the inertia values computed with the different values of k.
3. Answer the following question: What’s the best value for k?

## Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data 
Use the K-means algorithm along with the best value for k that you found by using the original data. Specifically, you’ll use them to cluster the cryptocurrencies according to the provided price changes of the cryptocurrencies provided. 

## Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis 
Perform PCA and reduce the features to three principal components. 

## Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data 
Use the elbow method to find the best value for k by using the PCA data. 

## Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data 
Use the PCA data, the K-means algorithm, and the best value for k that you found by using the PCA data. Specifically, you’ll use them to cluster the cryptocurrencies according to the principal components.  

## Visualize and Compare the Results 
Visually analyze the cluster analysis results by observing the outcome both with and without the use of optimization techniques.
